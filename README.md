# keywords_extractor_nlp
Keyword extraction in natural language processing (NLP) is an important topic because it enables the automatic identification of key terms or phrases from a given text. Keywords represent the main ideas or topics discussed in the text and can provide valuable insights for various applications.

some application areas:- 
1. Information Retrieval
2. Text Summarization
3. Document Clustering and Categorization(Extracted keywords can be used to cluster and categorize similar documents)
4. Content Analysis(It helps researchers gain insights into the main themes, trends, or topics discussed in a corpus of texts, enabling them to analyze and understand large volumes of information more efficiently)
5. SEO and Content Optimization(By identifying relevant keywords, website owners and content creators can optimize their content to improve search engine rankings and attract more targeted traffic)

steps followed by me in making this:- 
1. Preprocessing: The text data is preprocessed by removing unnecessary characters, stopwords (common words like "the," "and," etc.), and performing tokenization (splitting the text into individual words or tokens).
2. Feature Extraction: Various linguistic features like word frequency, part-of-speech tags, or tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) are computed to represent the importance of each word in the text.
3.Keyword Ranking: A ranking algorithm is applied to assign scores or weights to each word based on its features. This algorithm could be based on statistical methods, graph-based algorithms, or machine learning techniques.
4.Keyword Selection: The words with the highest scores or weights are selected as the extracted keywords.
5.Post-processing: The extracted keywords may undergo additional post-processing steps such as filtering out irrelevant or low-frequency terms, stemming (reducing words to their root forms), or applying domain-specific rules.
